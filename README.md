# Information Theory Final

This repository contains the following two pieces:

1. The answers to the written portion of the exam as a LaTeX file which can be read from `main.tex`.
2. The implementation of the fourth question, which is under `encdec-main/`. A detailed `README.md` file can be
found there with details about the code and how to run it.
